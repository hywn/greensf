				<h1>Our mission</h1>
				<p>We are a non-profit, student-run CSA (community supported agriculture) model bringing fresh, local produce and specialty items to the UVA community. We strive to foster a more sustainable relationship between UVA and Charlottesville food producers. We seek to provide students, faculty, and staff with access to fresh, seasonal, and local food on a weekly basis, while providing local farmers and artisans with dedicated support from the University community. Join us in eating well, supporting Central Virginia farmers, and celebrating local food.</p>
